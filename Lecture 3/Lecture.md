## ABM- Agent Based Modeling

- Conway's Game of Life
	- Obvious
- Consumer Purchase Behavior
	- Agent: The Consumer
	- Atttributes: age, gender, income level, occupation
	- Provide reviews on products, suggest products to other consumers
	- Most important takeaway- figure out what the agent interactions actually do
- Disease Modeling
	- Agents: People Transmitting the Disease
	- Attributes: Age, Underlying Conditions, Vaccinated, etc ...
	- Environment: A locality that contains the agents
	- Interactions: Going to the store, public transportation, any intrapersonal interaction
	- Why?: Figure out how quickly diseases spread, why it spreads quicker in one place rather than another, etc
- Mass Shootings
	- Agents: Students/Teachers/Staff
	- Environment: A School, Possibly Temple
	- Interactions: Two students hiding together, a shooer with a student (fatality)
- How the Subway Spreads Influenza in NYC
	- Agents: Population of NYC
	- Environment: NYC - Manhattan, The Bronx, Statten Island, The Bronx, Brookyln
	- Attributes: Collected from Census
	- Interactions: Contact between agents at school or work, as well as contact with the subway
	- Conclusions: 4.4% of infections happened on the subway, similar risk as going to work- largest percentage of infections was going to school.

Massive Software - Agent Based Modeling to Choreograph Crowd Scenes
	- Generates realistic CGI crowd or creatures in order to simulate specific behavior
	- Allows each agent to be governed by different rules
	- Makes large crowd scenes much easier

## Mexican Wave

Basically just the Wave you see at sports games.
Note: Nobody is directing the wave, people react to the ones on their left/right
